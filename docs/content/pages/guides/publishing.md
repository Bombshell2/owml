# Publishing Your Mod

This guide will give a quick overview of how to publish your mod to [the database](https://github.com/ow-mods/ow-mod-db){target="_blank"}.

## Setting Up A GitHub Repo

To get started, you'll want to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup){target="_blank"} and grab [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/){target="_blank"}.

Once opened, you'll want to select File -> Add Local Repository.  Then navigate to your mod's **source code folder** (NOT the folder your mod builds to), if you're using Visual Studio, this will most likely be located in `C:\Users\YourName\source\repos\YourModName\`.

Once selected, it should alert you that there isn't a repo there, just click the small link that says "create a repository here".

Fill the form it gives you out with info about your mod, the description field is what will be displayed in the mod manager.  

Check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README", we'll edit this in a bit.

When it asks for the Git Ignore, select "Visual Studio". And for license, select "MIT".

Now, with our repository created, select "Publish Repository" in the top right, this will push your repo to GitHub.

### Updating The README

Now head to your GitHub homepage, you should see your new mod in the sidebar on the left, click it.  

Scroll down until you see `README.md` this file is special is it will displayed on the mod website when people click on your mod.  

Click on it and then select the pencil icon in the top right of the file, this will open the web editor.  

This file format is called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/){target="_blank"}, it's a very simplistic way to write content for websites. If you don't know markdown you can use [this tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/){target="_blank"} to help you. Make sure your README gives a good description of your mod!

!!! alert-info "Tip"
    The first image in your README file will be used as the mod's thumbnail on the website, to insert an image, simply paste it inside of the editor. Make sure it's at the very top of your document.

## Releasing Your Mod

Now we're ready to release your mod, head over to the actions tab and select "Create Release", and in the top right select "Run Workflow", then simply run the workflow.  

After the workflow finishes, head back to the "Code" tab and select "releases" on the right sidebar, here you should see a new draft release, click on it.

Fill out the description with something like "First Release!", and press publish.  

You've successfully created a release on GitHub!

## Adding Your Mod To The Database

Now all that's left is to add your mod to the database, you can do so by following [this form](https://github.com/ow-mods/ow-mod-db/issues/new?assignees=&labels=add-mod&template=add-mod.yml&title=%5BYour+mod+name+here%5D){target="_blank"}. An admin will review your mod, make sure everything is setup correctly, and approve it into the database.  

Congratulations on publishing your first Outer Wilds mod!
